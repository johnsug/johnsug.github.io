title: Dashboard from Webscraping
subtitle: 'Breaking Trail' YouTube channel video counts

After a few iterations with my Garmin dashboard, I wanted to try something new and figured out how to scape video view counts from YouTube. I then selected one channel I've subscribed to -- [Breaking Trail](https://www.youtube.com/user/BreakingTrail) (an animal adventure channel I watch with my kids) -- tagged the videos for content, and turned the data into a Tableau public dashboard. You can view the final product [here](https://public.tableau.com/views/BraveWildernessTreemap/Dashboard?:embed=y&:display_count=yes).
