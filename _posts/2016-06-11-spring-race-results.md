I ran the [Heartland 39.3 half marathon series](http://heartland393.com/) this spring, three half marathons within five weeks. So how did I do?

### Rock the Parkway [1:55:17]

My favorite race of the spring, despite it being 35 degrees outside!

I placed 1172 / 4226 overall (or, was in the 72nd percentile) and placed 147 / 263 in my division (44th percentile).

### Garmin [2:04:06]

I felt really good at the first of the race, but didn't do as well as I would have liked. This was due in part to this race happening one week after Rock the Parkway. I really liked the course (they changed it from last year). I hope to do the full Garmin marathon in 2017.

I placed 593 / 2038 overall (71st percentile) and placed 67 / 111 in my division (40th percentile).

### Running with the Cows [1:54:14]

The week before, I thought I was going to PR in this race (sub 1:50:00), until I got sick the night before. I still had a decent time -- best time all year, but no personal best -- but ended up sick with a fever afterwards.

I placed 269 / 1388 overall (81st percentile) and placed 31 / 79 in my division (61st percentile).

### Overall [5:53:37 / 1:57:53 average]

606 people ran all three races. Combining my times for all three races, I placed 147 / 606 overall (76th percentile) and placed 18 / 39 in my division (54th percentile).
