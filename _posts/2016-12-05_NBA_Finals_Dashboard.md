subtitle: Trying to recreate a VizWiz dashboard

One of my new favorite blogs to follow is http://www.vizwiz.com, written by Andy Kriebel. I was going to call Andy a Tableau ninja, but realized he has a legit "tableau title" -- [Zen Master](http://www.tableau.com/ZenMasters) -- which is pretty cool. (I guess calling yourself a "rockstar" or a "ninja" doesn't cut it these days...) 

Anyways, I was impressed [with a viz Andy recently created (mimicing another author)](http://www.vizwiz.com/2016/11/how-many-times-have-teams-been-to-world.html) and wanted to see if I could create a similar dashboard, without cheating and looking what he did. To mix it up, I used NBA (basketball) data instead of MLB (baseball). My response can be found here: https://public.tableau.com/views/NBA_Playoffs/Dashboard?:embed=y&:display_count=yes

The thing that took the longest time was getting the layout to look like I wanted :/ Tableau is super slick and very powerful, but it can be tedious to tweak the details. For that reason alone, I'll likely learn D3 in the future, which will enable me much more control over my visualizations (like what I'm currently able to do in R and Shiny).
