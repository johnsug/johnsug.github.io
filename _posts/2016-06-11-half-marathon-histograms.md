title: Half-Marathon Time-to-Completion Histograms

I'm starting this blog off by playing to my strengths: evaluating myself :)

I ran the [Heartland 39.3 half marathon series](http://heartland393.com/) this spring -- three half marathons within five weeks. So how did I do?

### Rock the Parkway [1:55:17]

This was my favorite race of the spring, despite it being something like 35 degrees outside! I wasn't exactly sure how well I'd do, so I just went out, had some fun, and had a decent run.

I ended up placing 147 / 263 in my division (or, was in the 44th percentile) and placed 1172 / 4226 (72 percentile) overall.

### Garmin [2:04:06]

I felt really good at the beginning of the race, but didn't do as well as I would have liked. This was due in part to this race happening one week after Rock the Parkway, and partly due to some hills towards the end of the race that really drained me. That being said, I really liked the course (they changed it up from last year). I'm planning on doing the full Garmin marathon next year.

I placed 67 / 111 in my division (40th percentile) and placed 593 / 2038 overall (71st percentile).

### Running with the Cows [1:54:14]

The week of the race, I was feeling very confident and thought I was going to set a personal record in this race (sub 1:50:00). Things were peachy until the day before, when I started coming down with something. I still had a decent time -- best time all year, but no personal best -- but ended up sick with a fever afterwards.

I placed 67 / 111 in my division (40th percentile) and placed 269 / 1388 overall (81st percentile).

### Overall [5:53:37 / 1:57:53 average]

606 people ran all three races. Combining my times for all three races, I placed 18 / 39 in my division (54th percentile) and placed 147 / 606 overall (76th percentile).
