title: Top 100 Truck Bottleneck List
---

A friend shared this list with me, a list of the 100 top worst traffic bottlenecks in the U.S.: http://atri-online.org/2017/01/17/2017-top-100-truck-bottleneck-list/ 

(Fun fact: I used to work right next (#9)[http://atri-online.org/research/results/congestion_mobility/2017bottleneck/009.pdf], and pass (#62)[http://atri-online.org/research/results/congestion_mobility/2017bottleneck/062.pdf] everyday on my way to school. That's one of the reasons I don't live in Atlanta any more...) 

Anyway, I thought the list would be fun to visualize. I first wrote a script in Python to pull in the GPS coordinates, then plotted using (leaflet)[https://rstudio.github.io/leaflet/] -- my favorite plotting package in R.
