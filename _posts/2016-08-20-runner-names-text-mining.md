title: Half-Marathon Runner Names 
subtitle: Text mining / frequency analysis of runners' first names

I started this blog to practice text mining and spacial analysis. These next two posts will help me practice.

For a simple text mining exercise, I thought I'd look at the most common first names of runners who ran the Rock the Parkway half marathon, the first race of the Heartland 39.3 Half Marathon series.

![Female First Names](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/johnsug/johnsug.github.io/master/_posts/race_names/2016-parkway-names-female.png)

I wasn't too surprised by the top names -- this was a race in the midwestern United States, and the top names follow common European names. (My first name, as vanilla as they come, was tied for first place -- at least I came in first place somehow :p )

To make things a bit more interesting, I thought I'd next drill down and look at the distribution of first letters of the first names:

![Female First Letters](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/johnsug/johnsug.github.io/master/_posts/race_names/2016-parkway-letters-female.png)

While I knew that my first name was extremely common, I didn't realize that "J" names, especially "J" names for males, were so popular. (Top first-letters for female names -- "A", "J", "K", "M", and "S", or at least "A", "M", and "S" -- were less surprising.)
